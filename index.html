          Curiosity is one of the first traits we express as children. We are
          curious about the world around us, and even the simplest things can
          seem miraculous. Growing up in Missouri was a comfortable and safe
          experience, but it lacked excitement. That feeling of "missing out"
          and wanting to experience an adventure inspired me to seek places that
          would fill that emptiness, but help me flourish by being exposed to
          different cultures.

          I recently went on a trip with my family through a group travel
          company, Expat Explore, where we were able to visit 11 different
          countries in 17 days. It was absolutely amazing!
